# Generate a Word-Cloud of Someone's Tweets
I have discussed the code [in this thread](https://twitter.com/polfosol/status/1229037431934136320). It was one of my first experiences, i.e. the code is quite old.

Due to the changes imposed by [The Great Asshole](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) on twitter's API, the code no longer works and there is no way to fix it.
