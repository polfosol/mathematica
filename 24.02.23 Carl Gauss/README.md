# A Gaussian Prime That Looks Like Gauss
Testing whether the generated number discussed in [this thread](https://twitter.com/polfosol/status/1760976157087068502) is prime _and_ gaussian.

The number was generated using [primify](https://pypi.org/project/primify) package and python. But there are ways to do that [in _Mathematica_](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/ImageASCII/).
